About a week before submission date, I ahd to rewrite my database models completely as I was using lin tables like in an RDBMS, thinkking it would suffice, as there isn't a community wide agreeance on how best to model data in Mongo. As a result of this rewrite, I though it may be benefifical for myself to leave remnants of the old schemas around.

As such, the naming conventions may be a tad confusing.

In brief, a user is named user.
A thread or article in the news feed is known as content
Comments are called posts
and likes and favourites are self-explanatory.
You'll see collections of tables and link tables which will match up.

These are the old schema objects, the new schema objects represent a user, and a piece of content,
with content featuring nested comments and favourites, and those comments having nested likes.
Their naming follows the convention of User, and ContentNew.

All other code in the app is sufficiently concise and commented, so should be understandable.
