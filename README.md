# Creating a MEAN stack app, the aim being to eventually have it act as a sort of Film & TV social media site.

#### Initial README file.

Once core work is done I will be concerned with:
- Retrieving info pertaining to a series, show, act-or/ress etc using _API calls_
- Allowing users to _create discussion threads_, while also _comment on news articles which are fetched elsewhere_ and presented on the home page.
- Giving the ability for users to have _chat in real-time_

######more info in future commits
