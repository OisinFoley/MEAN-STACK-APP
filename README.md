# Creating a MEAN stack app, the aim being to eventually have it act as a sort of Film & TV social media site.

#### README file 1.2

Once core work is done I will be concerned with:
- Retrieving info pertaining to a series, show, act-or/ress etc using _API calls_
- Allowing users to _create discussion threads_, while also _comment on news articles which are fetched elsewhere_ and presented on the home page.
- Giving the ability for users to have _chat in real-time_

Added in previous commits (1.1)

- Have added registration capabilites inc. relevant error checking and handling.
- Incorporated a factory to handle registration calls
- Make use of $location and $timeout services
- Small amount of message styling using ngAnimate
